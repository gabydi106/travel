<p>A food crawl around the world, visiting the finest restaurants and best-kept, hole-in-a-wall secrets. </p>

<p>Eating the world one city at a time.</p>

<h3>
<a id="manila" class="anchor" href="#manila" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Manila</h3>

<p>Food and culture are virtually indistinguishable in the Philippines, where the average person eats five meals daily.</p>

<h3>
<a id="hong-kong" class="anchor" href="#hong-kong" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hong Kong</h3>

<p>The ”culinary capital of Asia” offers thousands of restaurants, and some of the world’s best food. In fact, some say that the food in Hong Kong alone is reason enough to visit the city. </p>

<h3>
<a id="singapore" class="anchor" href="#singapore" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Singapore</h3>

<p>One of the best things about being in Singapore is undoubtedly the food. It is no secret that Singaporeans eat and drink with a passion. Singapore’s multi-cultural diversity is reflected in the variety of local cuisine it has to offer, from Chinese to Malay, Indian to Peranakan. </p>

<h3>
<a id="japan" class="anchor" href="#japan" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Japan</h3>

<p>Food is very serious business in Japan.</p>

<p>Though I spend a lot of time thinking about the things I eat, I am still blown away by how much thought goes into the preparation, consumption, and appreciation of Japanese food. There is a level of obsession with food in Japan that I’ve never seen anywhere else.</p>

<h3>
<a id="taiwan" class="anchor" href="#taiwan" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Taiwan</h3>

<p>It is considered bad manners in Taiwan to waste food, so wherever you eat in Taiwan, be sure to finish what’s on your plate! </p>

<h3>
<a id="bangkok-thailand" class="anchor" href="#bangkok-thailand" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bangkok, Thailand</h3>

<p>Thai cuisine is a perfect blend of four seasonings – salty, sweet, sour, and spicy. Almost every Thai dish combines all four tastes. And this one will definitely amuse you – Thai people do not prefer to eat with chopsticks! They use a spoon and fork to eat!</p>

The city is so diverse, it’s possible to dine around the world without ever leaving the city, even without having to break the bank!</p>
