Life is strange, sometimes beautiful, always tastes different, but the details are the important thing.\r\n\r\nEating the world one city at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n### Manila\r\n\r\nFood and culture are virtually indistinguishable in the Philippines, where the average person eats five meals daily.\r\n\r\n### Hong Kong\r\n\r\nThe ”culinary capital of Asia” offers thousands of restaurants, and some of the world’s best food. In fact, some say that the food in Hong Kong alone is reason enough to visit the city. \r\n\r\n### Singapore\r\n\r\nOne of the best things about being in Singapore is undoubtedly the food. It is no secret that Singaporeans eat and drink with a passion. Singapore’s multi-cultural diversity is reflected in the variety of local cuisine it has to offer, from Chinese to Malay, Indian to Peranakan. \r\n\r\n### Japan\r\n\r\nFood is very serious business in Japan.\r\n\r\nThough I spend a lot of time thinking about the things I eat, I am still blown away by how much thought goes into the preparation, consumption, and appreciation of Japanese food. There is a level of obsession with food in Japan that I’ve never seen anywhere else.\r\n\r\n### Taiwan\r\n\r\nIt is considered bad manners in Taiwan to waste food, so wherever you eat in Taiwan, be sure to finish what’s on your plate! \r\n\r\n### Bangkok, Thailand\r\n\r\nThai cuisine is a perfect blend of four seasonings – salty, sweet, sour, and spicy. Almost every Thai dish combines all four tastes. And this one will definitely amuse you – Thai people do not prefer to eat with chopsticks! They use a spoon and fork to eat!\r\n\r\n### Vancouver, BC\r\n\r\nVancouver has more Japanese restaurants than there are McD's and better dimsum than Hong Kong!\r\n\r\n### Montreal, QC\r\n\r\nThere's more to Montreal than smoked meat and poutine.\r\n\r\n### New York, NY\r\n\r\nThere are enough restaurants in New York City for one person to eat out every night for 54 years and never visit the same place twice.\r\n\r\n### Los Angeles, CA\r\n\r\nHome of the Lakers, the Hollywood sign, Disneyland, and a handful of the world's best restaurants. From quaint to red-carpet dishes, from celebrity chefs and top-rated cuisine to short order legends and bar-stool gourmet, the possibilities are endless in L.A.  The city is so diverse, it’s possible to dine around the world without ever leaving the city, even without having to break the bank!\r\n\r\n### San Francisco, CA\r\n\r\n_Every day's so caffeinated, I wish they were Golden Gated. Fillmore couldn't feel more miles away._\r\n_So, wrap me up return to sender. Let's forget this 5 year bender. Take me to my city by the Bay._\r\n\r\n_I never knew all that I had. Now Alcatraz don't sound so bad. At least they'd have a hella fine merlot._\r\n_If I could wish upon a star. I would hitch a cable car. To the one place that I'll always call my home._\r\n\r\n\r\n### Seattle, WA\r\n\r\n_Don't know what I was on, but I think it grows in Oregon so I kept on going, going, gone, right through._\r\n\r\n_I drove into Seattle rain, fell in love then missed the train that could a took me right back home to you._\r\n\r\n### London, UK\r\n\r\n_In London, love and scandal are considered the best sweeteners of tea._ - John Osborne\r\n\r\nYou can live like royalty in London. But remember, you're not the only princess in town.\r\n\r\n### Paris, France\r\n\r\nThe iconic _Parisienne_ embodies elegance and chic, combined effortlessly. Fall in love with the city of love.\r\n\r\n### Spain\r\n\r\nSpain has 7 out of the 50 restaurants on the list of “The World’s 50 Best Restaurants”, out of these seven restaurants, five are in the region of the Basque Country. \r\n\r\nIf you judge the region on a per capita basis, then the Basque Country wins, because it currently holds the honour of having the highest number of Michelin starred restaurants, per capita in the world.",
